# 📌 Why FinOps Arose

## 1️⃣ The Problem: Traditional IT Financial Models Don’t Fit the Cloud

Many companies are migrating to the cloud in large numbers, but they struggle because their economic and financial models are based on decades of traditional IT practices.

### Traditional IT characteristics:

- Emphasis on **owning infrastructure**, not consuming it.
- Finance operated on an **annual planning cycle**.
- The CFO and IT leadership defined the budget once per year.
- Large hardware purchases made at fixed intervals.
- Big focus on **capital expenditures (CapEx)**.
- Developers had to submit tickets and wait weeks or months for resources.
- Spending was predictable and centralized.

This model worked well for on-premises data centers.

## 2️⃣ What Changed with the Cloud

With cloud services like **AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform**:

- Developers can spin up servers instantly.
- Procurement delays disappear.
- Spending becomes:
  - **Variable**
  - **Decentralized**
  - **Consumption-based**
- Monthly bills contain a blizzard of SKUs.
- The environment changes constantly.

### Impact:

- The old procurement methods cannot keep up.
- Static annual budgeting fractures under pressure.
- Finance teams struggle to understand cloud bills.
- Costs can spiral out of control.

## 3️⃣ Structural Shift

- Traditional IT → owning
- Cloud model → consuming

Cloud introduced radically different financial dynamics:

| On-Premises IT | Cloud Computing |
|----------------|----------------|
| Owning infrastructure | Consuming services |
| Capital expenditures | Variable spending |
| Annual budget cycle | Continuous adjustment |
| Centralized control | Decentralized consumption |
| Fixed purchasing intervals | On-demand provisioning |

Traditional financial planning models were not built for the hyper-changing world of the cloud.

## 4️⃣ The Solution: FinOps

A new approach to cloud financial management was needed.

FinOps emerged as:

- A **dynamic and collaborative operating model**.
- Tailored to the realities of cloud computing.
- Designed to regain control while preserving cloud speed and flexibility.
- A way to discard the centralized, fragmented status quo.
